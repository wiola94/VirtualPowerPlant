# VirtualPowerPlant
Model of a virtual power plant as a part of MSc thesis


The repository is a part of the thesis about the system for Negawatt Virtual Power Plant, which heads up groups of heat pumps. Virtual Power Plant is a concept of connected power plants and regular users of electric power. The main aim of such a system is to take control over dependent installations in order to maintain good collaborations with power system and to make a profit. The program compares two types of heat pump operation. The first one (later called ‘Simple Mode’) did not take into consideration managing with the Virtual Power Plant concept and was a base version to economically compare it to the enhanced one. The second type of simulation ( later called ‘VPPMode’), was to manage dependent cells by a Virtual Power Plant way of thinking.
